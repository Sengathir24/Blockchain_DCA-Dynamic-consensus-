# Blockchain_DCA-Dynamic-consensus-
 A compact, single-file Flask simulator that demonstrates a multi-node blockchain with multiple consensus algorithms and a basic community governance flow. This repository is intended for experimentation, teaching, and demoing how an ML model might dynamically select a consensus algorithm in a simulated network.
